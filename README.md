## Hardware

Components:
 * Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB RAM version)
 * LCD monitor
 * Two way mirror plate ("spying mirror") with dimensions that fit the monitor (custom made by glazier craftsman)
 * USB microphone

Note there is no need for actually sticking or screwing the mirror plate on the screen: in my version, the plate simply leans against the monitor; just be sure it won't slip;
